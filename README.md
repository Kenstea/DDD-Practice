# DDD-Practice
A simple web application to demonstrate how to apply DDD practically with just basic CRUD but beautiful UI :)
It was created based on ASP.NET MVC5 template and AdminLTE.

#Technologies
- UI: AdminLTE
- Backend: ASP.NET MVC5, Entity Framework, ASP.NET Identity framework.

#Points:
- How to organize folder structure effectively.
- Apply DDD into the design (still failed, thought).
